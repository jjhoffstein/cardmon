# cardmon

Credit card benefits monitoring system.

## Overview

Monitors credit card marketing pages for changes, extracts Schumer box data (APRs, fees) from official T&Cs, and optionally uses LLM for benefits extraction.

## Architecture

- `cardmon/extractors/` - Plugin architecture for issuer-specific parsing
- `cardmon/models.py` - Pydantic schemas: Schumer, Benefits, Card, CheckResult
- `cardmon/repository.py` - SQLite storage
- `cardmon/fetcher.py` - Async HTTP with httpx
- `cardmon/monitor.py` - Orchestrator
- `cardmon/cli.py` - Typer CLI

## Key Patterns

- Add new issuer: create `extractors/newissuer.py`, implement `parse(soup) -> Schumer`, register in `extractors/__init__.py`
- Cards configured in `cards.yaml`, grouped by issuer
- `tcs_url` should be explicit for JS-rendered pages

## Commands

    cardmon sync          # Load cards from cards.yaml
    cardmon check         # Check all cards
    cardmon check --issuer chase
    cardmon queue         # Review queue
